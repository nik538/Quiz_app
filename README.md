# Quiz App 

This is a full-stack Quiz Application that I built as part of my learning journey in web development.  
The main goal of this project was to understand how a frontend and backend work together in a real-world application.

---

## Project Overview

The Quiz App allows users to attempt quiz questions and view their scores.  
While building this project, I focused on keeping the code simple, well-structured, and easy to understand rather than adding unnecessary complexity.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with React on the frontend and Python on the backend, along with basic deployment concepts.
